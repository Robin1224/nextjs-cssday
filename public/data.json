Now, we have most of the CSS features we wanted to have back then. But do we use them? Have we become more creative because of them? Is our work simpler? We tend to want what we don't have, and we don't always use what we do. Let's look at how it's now possible to do layout at the speed of thought and prototype à la CSS Zen Garden almost as quickly as we can sketch.",

No better way to explore the possibilities of CSS by stretching it to the max. Throw your certainties out of the window and start experimenting with new, elegant and joyful ways to design and code the Web. Sometimes a success, just as often a total fiasco – but always educational, humbling and fun!

We'll also take a look at examples and case studies to make things practical. And finally, we'll review developer tools that will help you investigate style performance bottlenecks.",

This session will ask whether “global” CSS is such a bad thing, if stylesheets themselves are really a good thing, if we really need to rely on a framework developed at a genocide fomenting social media company to add scope to CSS, and what we can learn about CSS from the critical reception of Swedish death metal band Entombed’s 1996 album, “To Ride, Shoot Straight, and Speak The Truth”.",

There was a time when websites existed as reflections of your personality or a shrine to your favourite band rather than carbon copies of a Facebook page or Twitter feed. Content wasn’t algorithmically curated, but shared through links pages and webrings. With today’s browsers and modern CSS, we have at our fingertips so many powerful APIs and tools to build the most incredible, beautiful and wonderfully pointless websites that have ever existed, in ways that are accessible and performant like never before. And in the wake of Twitter’s slow demise, the humble personal website is rising from the ashes. This is a manifesto for building something just for the fun of it, and a rallying cry to tell your story on a platform that’s entirely yours.",

How do we use them, and what hidden powers do they have? What are CSS containers, and what queries can they respond to? Let’s find out! While the basics look a lot like media queries, and can work as a drop-in replacement for many existing @media rules — there are some key differences to understand, and a lot more power than you might expect. Along the way we’ll encounter CSS fundamentals like normal flow, intrinsic and extrinsic sizing, value resolution, and more.

It’s easy to get caught up in the JavaScript of it all but in this talk, we’re going to dig into the nuances of styling these darlings of design. Together we’ll examine the cascade and learn how inheritance works when Shadow DOMs get involved. After a crash-course in terminology, we’ll explore some of the “gotchas”, look at browser inconsistencies, and I’ll proffer some compatibility approaches that won’t give you a migraine. We’ll wrap things up by zooming out and examining how we can use Web Components to build consistency in a codified design library through theming.",

There are many ways to build them, and new features in the web platform are about to make this a whole lot easier. You might not even need JavaScript. In this talk, you’ll learn all about dialogs, including the new ‘popover’ attribute, “modality” and using the top layer.",

This session will ask whether “global” CSS is such a bad thing, if stylesheets themselves are really a good thing, if we really need to rely on a framework developed at a genocide fomenting social media company to add scope to CSS, and what we can learn about CSS from the critical reception of Swedish death metal band Entombed’s 1996 album, “To Ride, Shoot Straight, and Speak The Truth”.",

There was a time when websites existed as reflections of your personality or a shrine to your favourite band rather than carbon copies of a Facebook page or Twitter feed. Content wasn’t algorithmically curated, but shared through links pages and webrings. With today’s browsers and modern CSS, we have at our fingertips so many powerful APIs and tools to build the most incredible, beautiful and wonderfully pointless websites that have ever existed, in ways that are accessible and performant like never before. And in the wake of Twitter’s slow demise, the humble personal website is rising from the ashes. This is a manifesto for building something just for the fun of it, and a rallying cry to tell your story on a platform that’s entirely yours.",

While the basics look a lot like media queries, and can work as a drop-in replacement for many existing @media rules — there are some key differences to understand, and a lot more power than you might expect. Along the way we’ll encounter CSS fundamentals like normal flow, intrinsic and extrinsic sizing, value resolution, and more.

Together we’ll examine the cascade and learn how inheritance works when Shadow DOMs get involved. After a crash-course in terminology, we’ll explore some of the “gotchas”, look at browser inconsistencies, and I’ll proffer some compatibility approaches that won’t give you a migraine. We’ll wrap things up by zooming out and examining how we can use Web Components to build consistency in a codified design library through theming.",

It made different transitions, especially in the first couple of years, until I found my final form for the longest time. Due to some addition to the language, it changed again recently and will change even more with modern CSS. In his talk, Manuel goes down memory lane and presents some of the most significant impacts that changed how we write CSS in the past, and he tries to predict future influences. He also explains why his project #100DaysOfMoreOrLessModernCSS was one of his best and worst ideas at the same time.",

All the brightest and most vivid shades are not allowed. Unacceptable, right?! Welcome to Web design for the last seven years. You might not know it but compared to native apps, you are in the sRGB Prison. After attending this talk you will understand the measurable, reproducible sensation we call color. You will understand Lab and OKLab color spaces, be comfortable with gamut volume plots, and be able to laugh at snake-oil claims about color gamut coverage in advertising. Having broken out of jail, and knowing the basics of perceptual uniformity, you will be really looking forward to seeing CSS Color 4 and 5 implemented in all browsers. This is an intermediate to advanced talk about the current state and near future of cutting edge color on the Web.",

Beyond flexbox and Grid, there is aspect-ratio, min, max and clamp functions, custom properties, and logical properties, all of which can help us solve common layout challenges. Plus a whole new range of features on the horizon (with some already landing in browsers!), including subgrid, container queries and the :has() pseudo-class (or “parent selector”). As developers, the challenge is no longer whether something can be done in CSS, but which of these tools to reach for in our CSS toolbox! This session will aim to bring you up to speed with modern CSS layout, and demonstrate some creative use cases.",

That's no longer the case, but CSS has been slow in adapting to this new reality and helping authors deal with their complexity explosion. As a result, authors have had to turn to complex CSS management strategies, like atomic CSS or CSS-in-JS, to keep things understandable. This is no longer the case! I'll go over a number of new pieces of CSS and DOM technology, both mature and upcoming, that helps authors manage their CSS and keep things understandable *without* having to adopt some complex new tooling.",

And where do those new Cascade Layers you might have heard of fit in? And oh, what exactly happens when you use an !important somewhere? In this insightful talk, we’ll take a look under the hood of browsers, and detail how they determine which CSS declarations to apply and which not.",

All the brightest and most vivid shades are not allowed. Unacceptable, right?! Welcome to Web design for the last seven years. You might not know it but compared to native apps, you are in the sRGB Prison. After attending this talk you will understand the measurable, reproducible sensation we call color. You will understand Lab and OKLab color spaces, be comfortable with gamut volume plots, and be able to laugh at snake-oil claims about color gamut coverage in advertising. Having broken out of jail, and knowing the basics of perceptual uniformity, you will be really looking forward to seeing CSS Color 4 and 5 implemented in all browsers. This is an intermediate to advanced talk about the current state and near future of cutting edge color on the Web.",

Beyond flexbox and Grid, there is aspect-ratio, min, max and clamp functions, custom properties, and logical properties, all of which can help us solve common layout challenges. Plus a whole new range of features on the horizon (with some already landing in browsers!), including subgrid, container queries and the :has() pseudo-class (or “parent selector”). As developers, the challenge is no longer whether something can be done in CSS, but which of these tools to reach for in our CSS toolbox! This session will aim to bring you up to speed with modern CSS layout, and demonstrate some creative use cases.",

As a result, authors have had to turn to complex CSS management strategies, like atomic CSS or CSS-in-JS, to keep things understandable. This is no longer the case! I'll go over a number of new pieces of CSS and DOM technology, both mature and upcoming, that helps authors manage their CSS and keep things understandable *without* having to adopt some complex new tooling.",

In the context of design, we often talk about using the three-act structure, characters, and how conflict is a key essential ingredient. But is it all there is? Steph spent a few years learning from the art of making documentaries, crime fiction, novels and the shortest of stories. In this session, Steph will show how understanding the essence and practice of story opens a world of possibilities and adds another dimension to your UX toolset. Better still, it’s less of a mystery than what you might think.",

In order to successfully build these experiences, we need to craft the right product design process that incorporates user values and quality as well as business impact and velocity into our practice. And, most importantly, we need to build a strong design-driven culture that integrates user experience design into product decision making and inspires teams to go above and beyond. In this talk, Basak will dig deeper into the new era of design culture that evolves around courage, values, and innovation and discuss ways to accelerate the product design process thoughtfully and maximize design maturity in organizations.",

At the heart of a successful design system is a collection of sturdy, robust front-end components that powers other applications' user interfaces. This talk covers what's involved in establishing a technical architecture for your design system, including front-end workshop environments, CSS architecture, implementing design tokens, popular libraries like React and Vue.js, deploying design systems, managing updates, and more.",

Humans only have limited mental capacity and no-one is ever operating at 100%. We are all influenced by the world around us and by how our minds work. As designers we need to be able to understand this and design for it. Combining psychology theory, the latest in UX techniques Joe will outline a modern design framework that matches the modern complex world we and our users live in. After all a designer who doesn’t understand psychology is going to be no more successful than an architect who doesn’t understand physics.",

The user’s experience. Every part of the organization must be infused with an understanding of great design. Your organization has to cross the UX Tipping Point. You must increase everyone’s exposure to users, communicate a solid experience vision, and install a culture of continual learning. With that, design will become your organization’s competitive advantage.",

                "description": "Rachel Andrew has been writing CSS for 20 years, and teaching people the things she has learned for almost as long. Since the early days of CSS, and certainly since \"CSS for Layout\" became a thing, we've been teaching CSS in pretty much the same way. Here is a block thing, here is an inline thing, this is the Box Model ... and here is this weird jumping through hoops that makes a layout. It's time for a change. In this talk Rachel will explain how, in the last few years, CSS has been refactored to an extent that to really explain how CSS works we need to change the way we teach and talk about the language. We need to look again at what it is to learn CSS. We need to leave our old ideas behind. It is only when we do, that we will stop supporting the idea that CSS is the fragile, broken, quirky language that its detractors would like to believe.",

Even more so when you consider the diversity of typographical practices in various languages and writing systems, but even when you don't. Luckily, CSS has tools to help you with that. However, as there is quite a few pieces interacting together, it may not be obvious at first sight how it all fits together, and the somewhat odd naming of the properties doesn't help. In this talk, Florian Rivoal will do a tour of all the relevant properties, explain how each work, how they interact, how a few special HTML elements and unicode characters fit into this picture, and the differences in behavior associated with different languages. He will also go through some practical limitations of existing implementations and possible work arounds, and will illustrate how to put all this into practice in a number of examples.",

We’ll be looking at some of the more common problems faced by designers and developers—from simple forms to complex data—showing what a difference a few small cosmetic changes can do to bring design to the next level.",

You heard about grid for a long time and it was finally shipped in Firefox, Chrome and Safari almost simultaneously in 2017. Most of you probably know how to use grid and you might already be using it in your projects. In this talk we are not going to talk about how grid layout works, instead we will discuss how it's implemented in the browser. Manuel Rego has been part of the team working on Grid Layout since 2014. He will share his experience implementing a CSS spec in a web rendering engine as well as address different aspects of the implementation process, highlighting some interesting details and explaining some issues that appeared along the way. Hopefully, after the talk you'll better understand what's going on behind the scenes when you use CSS Grid Layout in a webpage, and what it takes to implement a CSS feature in a web browser.",

Over time, this has resulted in a portion of the web community with a fundamental misunderstanding of CSS, not only of how to write it, but of what CSS is in the first place: a declarative, domain-specific programming language. How can those of us who know and love CSS convince this group to include CSS in their definition of programming language, and why is it so important?

Wait, how did crocodiles survive the meteorite impact when all the other dinosaurs died off? What did they know that velociraptors didn't? Did they have bunkers?

In the context of design, we often talk about using the three-act structure, characters, and how conflict is a key essential ingredient. But is it all there is? Steph spent a few years learning from the art of making documentaries, crime fiction, novels and the shortest of stories. In this session, Steph will show how understanding the essence and practice of story opens a world of possibilities and adds another dimension to your UX toolset. Better still, it’s less of a mystery than what you might think.",

In order to successfully build these experiences, we need to craft the right product design process that incorporates user values and quality as well as business impact and velocity into our practice. And, most importantly, we need to build a strong design-driven culture that integrates user experience design into product decision making and inspires teams to go above and beyond. In this talk, Basak will dig deeper into the new era of design culture that evolves around courage, values, and innovation and discuss ways to accelerate the product design process thoughtfully and maximize design maturity in organizations.",

At the heart of a successful design system is a collection of sturdy, robust front-end components that powers other applications' user interfaces. This talk covers what's involved in establishing a technical architecture for your design system, including front-end workshop environments, CSS architecture, implementing design tokens, popular libraries like React and Vue.js, deploying design systems, managing updates, and more.",

Humans only have limited mental capacity and no-one is ever operating at 100%. We are all influenced by the world around us and by how our minds work. As designers we need to be able to understand this and design for it. Combining psychology theory, the latest in UX techniques Joe will outline a modern design framework that matches the modern complex world we and our users live in. After all a designer who doesn’t understand psychology is going to be no more successful than an architect who doesn’t understand physics.",

A great experience was a nice-to-have, not a requirement. Times have changed. The cost of delivering a product is no longer a barrier to entry. Quality is no longer a differentiator. What’s left? The user’s experience. Every part of the organization must be infused with an understanding of great design. Your organization has to cross the UX Tipping Point. You must increase everyone’s exposure to users, communicate a solid experience vision, and install a culture of continual learning. With that, design will become your organization’s competitive advantage.",

Since the early days of CSS, and certainly since \"CSS for Layout\" became a thing, we've been teaching CSS in pretty much the same way. Here is a block thing, here is an inline thing, this is the Box Model ... and here is this weird jumping through hoops that makes a layout. It's time for a change. In this talk Rachel will explain how, in the last few years, CSS has been refactored to an extent that to really explain how CSS works we need to change the way we teach and talk about the language. We need to look again at what it is to learn CSS. We need to leave our old ideas behind. It is only when we do, that we will stop supporting the idea that CSS is the fragile, broken, quirky language that its detractors would like to believe.",

Even more so when you consider the diversity of typographical practices in various languages and writing systems, but even when you don't. Luckily, CSS has tools to help you with that. However, as there is quite a few pieces interacting together, it may not be obvious at first sight how it all fits together, and the somewhat odd naming of the properties doesn't help. In this talk, Florian Rivoal will do a tour of all the relevant properties, explain how each work, how they interact, how a few special HTML elements and unicode characters fit into this picture, and the differences in behavior associated with different languages. He will also go through some practical limitations of existing implementations and possible work arounds, and will illustrate how to put all this into practice in a number of examples.",

He’ll be looking at a poorly designed UI and refactoring it while providing some of the strategies and techniques designers use to give an interface that polished look. We’ll be looking at some of the more common problems faced by designers and developers—from simple forms to complex data—showing what a difference a few small cosmetic changes can do to bring design to the next level.",

You heard about grid for a long time and it was finally shipped in Firefox, Chrome and Safari almost simultaneously in 2017. Most of you probably know how to use grid and you might already be using it in your projects. In this talk we are not going to talk about how grid layout works, instead we will discuss how it's implemented in the browser. Manuel Rego has been part of the team working on Grid Layout since 2014. He will share his experience implementing a CSS spec in a web rendering engine as well as address different aspects of the implementation process, highlighting some interesting details and explaining some issues that appeared along the way. Hopefully, after the talk you'll better understand what's going on behind the scenes when you use CSS Grid Layout in a webpage, and what it takes to implement a CSS feature in a web browser.",

Over time, this has resulted in a portion of the web community with a fundamental misunderstanding of CSS, not only of how to write it, but of what CSS is in the first place: a declarative, domain-specific programming language. How can those of us who know and love CSS convince this group to include CSS in their definition of programming language, and why is it so important? This talk will provide your talking points for that conversation.",

I mean, it's pretty cool that birds are essentially fluffy dinosaurs. Then again, crocodiles are kind of actual, real dinosaurs, still living today! So, like, they win on that count. Wait, how did crocodiles survive the meteorite impact when all the other dinosaurs died off? What did they know that velociraptors didn't? Did they have bunkers? In any case, this talk is the story of a peculiar and peculiarly named CSS layout technique I came up with, what it means to write algorithmic layouts, and how to integrate this layout primitive into your design system via the custom elements spec.",

Animations are more often than not considered as superfluous, with every interaction effect or visual feedback not strictly required to makes things work considered as low priority. However, a human-centered design process is, in fact, key to a product's success. It contributes to create products people don't only need to use, but want to use, driving up user satisfaction and engagement. In this session, Benjamin will share real-world examples and best practices on how to deliver efficient and enjoyable experiences, build a brand that conveys trust, and make customers happy.",

                "description": "\"Data sketches\" was a year-long collaboration between Nadieh Bremer and Shirley Wu, both freelancing data visualisation designers. Each month they chose a topic and visualised it in an overly elaborate & geeky manner. But besides sharing the end result, they also wrote extensively about the creation process. In this talk, Nadieh will share her most important lessons learned in the fundamental areas of data, sketching & coding. About how some months became favourites, what mistakes were made, and how they were overcome. She'll highlight that many visualizations had humble, ugly duckling beginnings, but that through many (embarrassing) iterations they were turned into unique and, hopefully, compelling results.",

Often it’s caused by ambiguous buttons, labels or copywriting as well as severe problems related to finding or understanding products as well as slow and painful checkout experience. We can’t bring the abandonment rate to 0, but we can shave off at least 10% with some minor and straightforward optimizations. In this talk, we’ll look into the psychology of eCommerce and common ways to improve conversion, authentication, product listing and filtering, checkout optimizations, payment flows, optimizations for mobile and new opportunities. Let’s get to the bottom of a perfect eCommerce UX: that means removing distractions, minimizing friction and avoiding disruptions and dead ends caused by the interface.",

He was driven by a desire to improve and professionalise the industry, which is how he came to start the UKs first user experience consultancy, Clearleft. He never set out to be a design leader, but now find himself leading a team of thirty people, almost by accident. In a quest to understand what makes a great leader, and help his friends in newly minted leadership positions, Andy started the Leading Design conference and Slack community in 2016. Over the past couple of years, Andy has interviewed dozens of prominant leaders and listened in on hundreds of Slack conversations about the art and craft of leadership. In this session, Andy recounts his journey into leadership, shares his successes and failures, and the important lessons he’s learned on the way. The result is a talk packed full of design leadership heuristics suitable for anybody who is a leader, wants to be a leader, or has a leader.",

And why does it take so darned long to ship new features after implementation is begun, like the literal years it took to ship Grid? In this talk, Eric will focus on one of the biggest and least appreciated reasons: the growing friction of specification interaction. He'll not only explore some of the challenges specification authors and implementors face, but also how we all can help overcome that friction and keep the web interoperable.",

However, when compared to effects available in graphics editors such as Photoshop and the likes, CSS is still behind, by far. But SVG, on the other hand, is not that far behind. SVG comes with a set of filter primitives that enable you to recreate Photoshop-grade effects in the browser, using a few lines of code. While the syntax and attributes of these filters may seem intimidating and not very friendly at first, once you get a grasp of how they work, you'll have a very powerful tool in your arsenal, that allows you to push the boundaries of what is possible on the Web. In this talk, Sara is going to give you a crash course on SVG filters — why they are awesome, how they work, and examples of powerful effects you can create with them, in an friendly, easy-to-follow approach. Brace yourself, and get ready to set your imagination free and expand your creativity for what's possible on the Web today.",

In this talk we'll explore the problem space that CSS based container queries creates for browsers due to the architecture of the pipeline. More importantly, we'll utilize some newer JS APIs and clever CSS techniques to solve container query use cases - because is it really the width that we want to trigger the query on?",

A lot of frustration with CSS often arises from trying to wrangle all the content on the page into their proper locations. CSS has gradually expanded over the years, granting us an increasing degree of control over the alignment, positioning and layout of these boxes. CSS is ultimately a holistic technology, in that, even though you can use properties in isolation, the full power of CSS shines through when used in combination. This talk will not only dive into how box alignment works, but also cover its interactions with other key parts of CSS layout, like display and writing-mode, as well as show how this module will continue to evolve, making layout even easier moving forward.",

To some, CSS in JS just makes sense: it's local to your component, it can't leak and, hey, I know how to write JavaScript and CSS is weird. To others, CSS-in-JS is an abomination that makes them want to emulate Kimmie and \"release a fragrance\" in disdain. Why are scripters so afraid of the cascade? Why the hesitance about inheritance? Let's look at what CSS seems to lack, what the CSS-in-JS libraries can teach us, so we don't do as Kim's buttocks did and \"Break the Internet\".",

Animations are more often than not considered as superfluous, with every interaction effect or visual feedback not strictly required to makes things work considered as low priority. However, a human-centered design process is, in fact, key to a product's success. It contributes to create products people don't only need to use, but want to use, driving up user satisfaction and engagement. In this session, Benjamin will share real-world examples and best practices on how to deliver efficient and enjoyable experiences, build a brand that conveys trust, and make customers happy.",

In this talk, Nadieh will share her most important lessons learned in the fundamental areas of data, sketching & coding. About how some months became favourites, what mistakes were made, and how they were overcome. She'll highlight that many visualizations had humble, ugly duckling beginnings, but that through many (embarrassing) iterations they were turned into unique and, hopefully, compelling results.",

Often it’s caused by ambiguous buttons, labels or copywriting as well as severe problems related to finding or understanding products as well as slow and painful checkout experience. We can’t bring the abandonment rate to 0, but we can shave off at least 10% with some minor and straightforward optimizations. In this talk, we’ll look into the psychology of eCommerce and common ways to improve conversion, authentication, product listing and filtering, checkout optimizations, payment flows, optimizations for mobile and new opportunities. Let’s get to the bottom of a perfect eCommerce UX: that means removing distractions, minimizing friction and avoiding disruptions and dead ends caused by the interface.",

He was driven by a desire to improve and professionalise the industry, which is how he came to start the UKs first user experience consultancy, Clearleft. He never set out to be a design leader, but now find himself leading a team of thirty people, almost by accident. In a quest to understand what makes a great leader, and help his friends in newly minted leadership positions, Andy started the Leading Design conference and Slack community in 2016. Over the past couple of years, Andy has interviewed dozens of prominant leaders and listened in on hundreds of Slack conversations about the art and craft of leadership. In this session, Andy recounts his journey into leadership, shares his successes and failures, and the important lessons he’s learned on the way. The result is a talk packed full of design leadership heuristics suitable for anybody who is a leader, wants to be a leader, or has a leader.",

                    "description": "In March 2017, four major browsers shipped stable, consistent CSS Grid implementations in the span of just three weeks. That's amazing-- but wait, why aren't ALL new feature debuts like that? And why does it take so darned long to ship new features after implementation is begun, like the literal years it took to ship Grid? In this talk, Eric will focus on one of the biggest and least appreciated reasons: the growing friction of specification interaction. He'll not only explore some of the challenges specification authors and implementors face, but also how we all can help overcome that friction and keep the web interoperable.",

                    "description": "When it comes to graphical effects on the Web, CSS has already come a long way in the last few years, with the introduction of CSS filters and blend modes a few years back. However, when compared to effects available in graphics editors such as Photoshop and the likes, CSS is still behind, by far. But SVG, on the other hand, is not that far behind. SVG comes with a set of filter primitives that enable you to recreate Photoshop-grade effects in the browser, using a few lines of code. While the syntax and attributes of these filters may seem intimidating and not very friendly at first, once you get a grasp of how they work, you'll have a very powerful tool in your arsenal, that allows you to push the boundaries of what is possible on the Web. In this talk, Sara is going to give you a crash course on SVG filters — why they are awesome, how they work, and examples of powerful effects you can create with them, in an friendly, easy-to-follow approach. Brace yourself, and get ready to set your imagination free and expand your creativity for what's possible on the Web today.",

The request for container queries from web developers and designers seems to be everywhere. Why then, for something that is so commonly requested, not being solved? Or isn't it…? In this talk we'll explore the problem space that CSS based container queries creates for browsers due to the architecture of the pipeline. More importantly, we'll utilize some newer JS APIs and clever CSS techniques to solve container query use cases - because is it really the width that we want to trigger the query on?",

A lot of frustration with CSS often arises from trying to wrangle all the content on the page into their proper locations. CSS has gradually expanded over the years, granting us an increasing degree of control over the alignment, positioning and layout of these boxes. CSS is ultimately a holistic technology, in that, even though you can use properties in isolation, the full power of CSS shines through when used in combination. This talk will not only dive into how box alignment works, but also cover its interactions with other key parts of CSS layout, like display and writing-mode, as well as show how this module will continue to evolve, making layout even easier moving forward.",

To some, CSS in JS just makes sense: it's local to your component, it can't leak and, hey, I know how to write JavaScript and CSS is weird. To others, CSS-in-JS is an abomination that makes them want to emulate Kimmie and \"release a fragrance\" in disdain. Why are scripters so afraid of the cascade? Why the hesitance about inheritance? Let's look at what CSS seems to lack, what the CSS-in-JS libraries can teach us, so we don't do as Kim's buttocks did and \"Break the Internet\".",

Nowadays the state of the art has advanced with the Constraint Validation API and the CSS :invalid pseudo-class. That sounds great ... until you actually try to use them. In this presentation PPK will discuss how the API works, why it is not all that great, and draw some valuable lessons about how not to design APIs. He'll also tell you how to validate your forms properly.",

The Web Audio API is extremely powerful, we can create sounds, load them, analyse them, modify them in an insane amount of different ways. This is an in-depth talk into the different methods of the API and not just the details, but how best we could use them in our development work flow. What techniques really come in useful when loading and manipulating sounds? We'll outline just that so you can go away feeling more confident knowing you that yes you can use audio! And if all that wasn't enough, there's just a sprinkling of MIDI to go on top.",

For some of us, we may quickly find 80% of our users have support for the spec. For others, we can take advantage of Grid in a progressively enhanced way - leaning on CSS Feature Queries to detect support. Grid enables a whole range of layout possibilities, both in terms of streamlining existing patterns and in creating new design possibilities for the web. This is a talk about Grid Layout, and the previously impossible tasks that grid makes possible. However it is also a talk about what it is to do CSS layout in 2017. I’ll be sharing the things I’ve learned about layout, as I’ve learned about Grid. Passing on the key lessons that can help you really take advantage of what has shipped in browsers already, and the things that are to come.",

This talk will delve into grid design theory and make it applicable for today’s web. We’ll tackle how you systematically make decisions about how to approach grid design and resulting layout. How you create connectedness between design elements and how a well-designed grid can help answer a plethora of design problems in your process. Mark will bridge the gap between grid design and layout theory and modern web design that you can put into practice tomorrow. Together we might just move the web on from 12 columns for the next decade.",

                "description": "The web was invented to display text in a left-to-right horizontal writing mode — the way English and other western European languages flow. But as Bruce Lawson says, WWW stands for the World Wide Web, not the Western Wealthy Web. It's more important now than ever to be inclusive and global in our thinking, and resist imperialistic and nationalistic impulses. Of course, over time the web has evolved. Unicode and the bidirectional algorithm provide support for right-to-left languages. More recently, the CSS Writing Mode specification added support for scripts that are typeset vertically. This talk will go through the Writing Mode Specification, unpacking our landscape of CSS tools for typesetting a complex range of written language. You'll also learn tricks for using writing mode properties to typeset graphic design effects for horizontal languages.",

I always knew that something amazing would happen and that this feature would allow things beyond our imagination. While the use case for variables might be very obvious the features are often underestimated. Variables in CSS allow behavior that was preivously not possible. Looking at every detail and reading the specs carefully can deliver some interesting facts. I found awesome but also scary possibilities and created examples for any use case I could think of. It turns out that CSS variables are a real \"Game changer\" with one mind blowing feature after the other. You want to interact between CSS and JS, you're looking for a layout framework, or simply want to reduce your code base? CSS variables cover all these cases and a lot more.",

For example, you can use the clip-path property and the circle() function to clip and element in a circle of your liking. A circle is a \"basic shape\" in CSS, just as it is in SVG, and you can use these basic shapes as values for a number of CSS properties. Basic shapes don't include \"path\" though, which is the ultimate vector defining syntax. In a strange twist, path() does exist in CSS, in places that don't support basic shapes! In other words, it’s complicated. In this session Chris will show you how to carefully navigate this minefield.",

What techniques really come in useful when loading and manipulating sounds? We'll outline just that so you can go away feeling more confident knowing you that yes you can use audio!

In this talk I've cover a handful of browser DOM APIs that can get pretty weird. We'll learn about some of the warts of the web platform, why we're mostly stuck with them, and ideally how we can learn from their mistakes. Come get weird with the Fullscreen API, DOM Events, Indexed DB, showModalDialog, CSSStyleDeclaration, Canvas, WebRTC APIs... and more!",

For some of us, we may quickly find 80% of our users have support for the spec. For others, we can take advantage of Grid in a progressively enhanced way - leaning on CSS Feature Queries to detect support. Grid enables a whole range of layout possibilities, both in terms of streamlining existing patterns and in creating new design possibilities for the web. This is a talk about Grid Layout, and the previously impossible tasks that grid makes possible. However it is also a talk about what it is to do CSS layout in 2017. I’ll be sharing the things I’ve learned about layout, as I’ve learned about Grid. Passing on the key lessons that can help you really take advantage of what has shipped in browsers already, and the things that are to come.",

What started with a few blog posts by an influential couple of design bloggers in 2006 found its way into new (at the time) CSS frameworks and that was that. However, there is way more to designing grids than choosing how many columns you want. Lucky for us, with Grid Layout, we have a powerful tool to realise those grids. This talk will delve into grid design theory and make it applicable for today’s web. We’ll tackle how you systematically make decisions about how to approach grid design and resulting layout. How you create connectedness between design elements and how a well-designed grid can help answer a plethora of design problems in your process. Mark will bridge the gap between grid design and layout theory and modern web design that you can put into practice tomorrow. Together we might just move the web on from 12 columns for the next decade.",

But as Bruce Lawson says, WWW stands for the World Wide Web, not the Western Wealthy Web. It's more important now than ever to be inclusive and global in our thinking, and resist imperialistic and nationalistic impulses. Of course, over time the web has evolved. Unicode and the bidirectional algorithm provide support for right-to-left languages. More recently, the CSS Writing Mode specification added support for scripts that are typeset vertically. This talk will go through the Writing Mode Specification, unpacking our landscape of CSS tools for typesetting a complex range of written language. You'll also learn tricks for using writing mode properties to typeset graphic design effects for horizontal languages.",

I always knew that something amazing would happen and that this feature would allow things beyond our imagination. While the use case for variables might be very obvious the features are often underestimated. Variables in CSS allow behavior that was preivously not possible. Looking at every detail and reading the specs carefully can deliver some interesting facts. I found awesome but also scary possibilities and created examples for any use case I could think of. It turns out that CSS variables are a real \"Game changer\" with one mind blowing feature after the other. You want to interact between CSS and JS, you're looking for a layout framework, or simply want to reduce your code base? CSS variables cover all these cases and a lot more.",

                    "description": "There are some values in CSS that allow you to create shapes. For example, you can use the clip-path property and the circle() function to clip and element in a circle of your liking. A circle is a \"basic shape\" in CSS, just as it is in SVG, and you can use these basic shapes as values for a number of CSS properties. Basic shapes don't include \"path\" though, which is the ultimate vector defining syntax. In a strange twist, path() does exist in CSS, in places that don't support basic shapes! In other words, it’s complicated. In this session Chris will show you how to carefully navigate this minefield.",

On the other hand, those same resources can in some cases block the browser's HTML parser, as they may change the eventual result. Over the years browsers have developed mechanisms to cope with that, to make sure resources are discovered even if the parser is blocked. At the same time, the link element is used to signify a relation between the current page and other resources. It allows us to tell the browser that a certain page should be styled using a certain resource, has an RSS feed alternative, is likely to be followed by another page and much more. In this talk we'll discuss the connection between these two seemingly separate subjects, and talk about a number of new link relations that enable us to improve the browser's resource discovery process, and get us faster loading Web pages.",

Sure, that makes it easy to write bad code, but it also allows HTML to be both backwards and future compatible. It allowed the HTML5 specification to extend the existing form field types. It allowed the RICG to create the picture element. And it forms the basis of Web Components because it makes custom elements possible. And most importantly, it allows the noscript tag, which by definition does absolutely nothing. This talk will explain the concepts behind graceful degradation, progressive enhancement and feature detection, and focus on how to solve practical problems with these concepts.",

From form targets to sandboxes to websites-in-a-website to seamless pseudo-element to parallel processing to unblocked preloading to clickjacking. In my talk we'll dive deeper into what it's like to be an iframe. We'll look at what the spec has to say about them and how they are used in the wild.

No matter how well you think you know HTML, this talk will prove to you that there’s still more to explore. Also that you probably use too much Javascript for things that don’t need it anymore. Prepare to be surprised at how many elements, attributes, even entire HTML-based technologies exist that you’ve never learned, and how they could be useful in your projects, today.",

CSS, on the other hand, is a mere adolescent—born in 1996, it’s just 18 years old. This means that software engineers have had over four decades’ head start on us: we should be listening to a lot more of what they have to say. In this talk, we’ll take a look at some very traditional computer science and software engineering paradigms and how we can steal, bend, borrow, and reimplement them when writing our CSS. Writing CSS like software engineers so that we can become better CSS developers.",

Everyone felt much better after this, and went and had a cup of tea. But while everyone was drinking tea (and not really paying attention), the line between design and structure began to get messy again. Things like the before/after pseudo-selectors made it possible for CSS to directly change content, and features like FlexBox push the concept of separation to breaking point. Conversely, CSS is being used as a development tool for visualising semantic information like role and state, when added to an interface using ARIA. In this talk Léonie will look at the changing relationship between design and structure, and what it means for accessibility mechanics in the browser. She will share CSS code examples and design patterns for solving common accessibility problems, so everyone can go and have another nice cup of tea.",

Without media queries the web would be much less flexible. But media queries are hard work. We have to decide when a breakpoint occurs, we have to decide how it looks at that breakpoint, and we have to write the code to make it so. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could simply tell the content to behave? To behave in a matter that makes sense, according to a set of rules, a system, we come up with. In other words: instead of crafting every possible layout by hand, wouldn’t it be better if we go home early and let the computer do the work for us? It turns out that CSS gives us quite some tools to create super flexible, responsive layouts that don’t use media queries. Some are old, like floats and CSS columns. Some are newer, like flexbox and viewport relative units. And others existed for ages, we simply didn’t know they did yet.",

Static SVG images created by graphics software rarely use CSS, but a little CSS code can transform those SVG files into dynamic, interactive, and responsive graphics. This session will introduce many of the ways CSS can be used to enhance SVG. It will start by outlining how CSS for SVG is similar and different from CSS for HTML, with some practical tips to avoid common difficulties. Then we will start having some fun. It will be a rapid overview of the (many) possibilities, not a detailed tutorial. The discussion should be accessible to SVG beginners — assuming you know a thing or two about CSS! However, it will not be a general introduction to SVG, instead focusing on how you can adapt and enhance existing SVG code.",

What, in fact, is color anyway - isn't it kind of subjective? After attending this talk you will understand that color is a measurable, reproducible sensation; standardized since 1931! You will get white point adaptation (you already know this, you maybe just don't know the term). You will understand Lab color space, be comfortable with gamut volume plots, and be able to laugh at snake-oil claims about color gamut coverage in advertising. You will be really looking forward to seeing CSS4 Color implemented in all the browsers (and the HTML/CSS to PDF converters). And just maybe, you will be kinda pissed we had to wait this long to get what print media has taken for granted for decades, now.

On the other hand, those same resources can in some cases block the browser's HTML parser, as they may change the eventual result. Over the years browsers have developed mechanisms to cope with that, to make sure resources are discovered even if the parser is blocked. At the same time, the link element is used to signify a relation between the current page and other resources. It allows us to tell the browser that a certain page should be styled using a certain resource, has an RSS feed alternative, is likely to be followed by another page and much more. In this talk we'll discuss the connection between these two seemingly separate subjects, and talk about a number of new link relations that enable us to improve the browser's resource discovery process, and get us faster loading Web pages.",

Sure, that makes it easy to write bad code, but it also allows HTML to be both backwards and future compatible. It allowed the HTML5 specification to extend the existing form field types. It allowed the RICG to create the picture element. And it forms the basis of Web Components because it makes custom elements possible. And most importantly, it allows the noscript tag, which by definition does absolutely nothing. This talk will explain the concepts behind graceful degradation, progressive enhancement and feature detection, and focus on how to solve practical problems with these concepts.",

From form targets to sandboxes to websites-in-a-website to seamless pseudo-element to parallel processing to unblocked preloading to clickjacking. In my talk we'll dive deeper into what it's like to be an iframe. We'll look at what the spec has to say about them and how they are used in the wild.

CSS, on the other hand, is a mere adolescent—born in 1996, it’s just 18 years old. This means that software engineers have had over four decades’ head start on us: we should be listening to a lot more of what they have to say. In this talk, we’ll take a look at some very traditional computer science and software engineering paradigms and how we can steal, bend, borrow, and reimplement them when writing our CSS. Writing CSS like software engineers so that we can become better CSS developers.",

                    "description": "When the web was new, design and structure were all mixed up together. Eventually we realised this was very messy, so we invented CSS and separated design from HTML. Everyone felt much better after this, and went and had a cup of tea. But while everyone was drinking tea (and not really paying attention), the line between design and structure began to get messy again. Things like the before/after pseudo-selectors made it possible for CSS to directly change content, and features like FlexBox push the concept of separation to breaking point. Conversely, CSS is being used as a development tool for visualising semantic information like role and state, when added to an interface using ARIA. In this talk Léonie will look at the changing relationship between design and structure, and what it means for accessibility mechanics in the browser. She will share CSS code examples and design patterns for solving common accessibility problems, so everyone can go and have another nice cup of tea.",

                    "description": "Media queries gave us the power to create responsive layouts that work on all kinds of screens: from small to huge. Without media queries the web would be much less flexible. But media queries are hard work. We have to decide when a breakpoint occurs, we have to decide how it looks at that breakpoint, and we have to write the code to make it so. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could simply tell the content to behave? To behave in a matter that makes sense, according to a set of rules, a system, we come up with. In other words: instead of crafting every possible layout by hand, wouldn’t it be better if we go home early and let the computer do the work for us? It turns out that CSS gives us quite some tools to create super flexible, responsive layouts that don’t use media queries. Some are old, like floats and CSS columns. Some are newer, like flexbox and viewport relative units. And others existed for ages, we simply didn’t know they did yet.",

The new age of email is a fully interactive experience based in modern CSS (with a solid fallback for Outlook). Some of the things we've been seeing in recent emails include: Tabbed layouts, Image galleries, Multiple pages, Price calculations, Analytics on interactions, Games, Live content & 3D CSS. We'll look over the code behind these whilst covering: A brief overview of current CSS support in email clients, Detecting interaction with CSS, Basic interactions - The Checkbox Hack, Advanced interactions - Introduction to Punched Card Coding",

                    "description": "When deciding how to integrate graphical effects in your web design, it's easy to see CSS and SVG as competing options. But these two tools are better together. Static SVG images created by graphics software rarely use CSS, but a little CSS code can transform those SVG files into dynamic, interactive, and responsive graphics. This session will introduce many of the ways CSS can be used to enhance SVG. It will start by outlining how CSS for SVG is similar and different from CSS for HTML, with some practical tips to avoid common difficulties. Then we will start having some fun. It will be a rapid overview of the (many) possibilities, not a detailed tutorial. The discussion should be accessible to SVG beginners — assuming you know a thing or two about CSS! However, it will not be a general introduction to SVG, instead focusing on how you can adapt and enhance existing SVG code.",

Which used to be in (well you get the idea). Why has color management taken so long to get going on the Web? Isn't it kind of esoteric and specialized - what does it do for you, in practical terms? What, in fact, is color anyway - isn't it kind of subjective? After attending this talk you will understand that color is a measurable, reproducible sensation; standardized since 1931! You will get white point adaptation (you already know this, you maybe just don't know the term). You will understand Lab color space, be comfortable with gamut volume plots, and be able to laugh at snake-oil claims about color gamut coverage in advertising. You will be really looking forward to seeing CSS4 Color implemented in all the browsers (and the HTML/CSS to PDF converters). And just maybe, you will be kinda pissed we had to wait this long to get what print media has taken for granted for decades, now. If you go out and buy a wide-gamut, calibrated monitor after this, I disclaim all responsibility :)",

Flexbox gives you more control over the things you care about in a responsive layout—like order, alignment, and proportional sizes of your boxes—and lets the browser figure out the rest—the math-y stuff that computers are good at, like the exact dimensions that are needed on the boxes to perfectly fill the available space. You can create much more complex and reliable layouts with flexbox than you can with floats, table display, or inline-block, all with far less CSS. In this talk, you’ll learn which features of flexbox are particularly suited to responsive layouts and how you can harness them today by applying flexbox as progressive enhancement. We’ll look at examples of responsive page components and patterns that you can enhance further by layering flexbox on top of other layout methods, ensuring all users get a good experience.",

At the same time, type designers are coming up with clever solutions to problems associated with fonts for the web.

                    "description": "Flexbox and responsive web design go great together, like peanut butter and jelly. Flexbox gives you more control over the things you care about in a responsive layout—like order, alignment, and proportional sizes of your boxes—and lets the browser figure out the rest—the math-y stuff that computers are good at, like the exact dimensions that are needed on the boxes to perfectly fill the available space. You can create much more complex and reliable layouts with flexbox than you can with floats, table display, or inline-block, all with far less CSS. In this talk, you’ll learn which features of flexbox are particularly suited to responsive layouts and how you can harness them today by applying flexbox as progressive enhancement. We’ll look at examples of responsive page components and patterns that you can enhance further by layering flexbox on top of other layout methods, ensuring all users get a good experience.",

As browsers slowly implement support for font features, color font formats and better control over font display during loading, authors will be better able to customize more precisely how type appears in the browser. At the same time, type designers are coming up with clever solutions to problems associated with fonts for the web. This session will cover the current state of type in the browser and improvements on the horizon.",

Today, and in the near future, much of this pain will disappear, as CSS introduces new layout specs, like Flexbox and Grid, and other layout tools, like the Sizing and Alignment specs. This session will explore some of the new abilities enabled by CSS's new layout specs, introducing you to techniques that can you can apply today (depending on your required browser support) and in the near future, as browsers continue to implement these new specs.",

This results in a form of presentational markup that, despite breaking with the \"separation of concerns\" principle, has proven to be a popular approach to collaborating on style schemas. However, methodologies and standards are not equivalent and inviting the explicit prescription of CSS into the editorial process will quickly alienate non-developers charged with simply writing content. This session will explore ways to help content editors elicit stylistic nuances without having to think about design or CSS at all.",

Today, and in the near future, much of this pain will disappear, as CSS introduces new layout specs, like Flexbox and Grid, and other layout tools, like the Sizing and Alignment specs. This session will explore some of the new abilities enabled by CSS's new layout specs, introducing you to techniques that can you can apply today (depending on your required browser support) and in the near future, as browsers continue to implement these new specs.",

This results in a form of presentational markup that, despite breaking with the \"separation of concerns\" principle, has proven to be a popular approach to collaborating on style schemas. However, methodologies and standards are not equivalent and inviting the explicit prescription of CSS into the editorial process will quickly alienate non-developers charged with simply writing content. This session will explore ways to help content editors elicit stylistic nuances without having to think about design or CSS at all.",
